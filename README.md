# Kryal_cube_mk1.2-ABL

+ Today I am building ABL sensor to 3d printer Kryal Cube mk1.2
+ In this solution we're using Z Endstop as calibration switch that means, we don't need Z Endstop anymore

## Manuals to install ABL on Kryal Cube mk1.2:
 
**- 1.)** [English manual](https://github.com/BlackRiverCoder/Kryal_cube_mk1.2-ABL/blob/main/Assests/Manuals/English_manual.txt)

**- 2.)** [Slovak Manual](https://github.com/BlackRiverCoder/Kryal_cube_mk1.2-ABL/blob/main/Assests/Manuals/Slovak_manual.txt)

## Models:

## English Manual:

***1.) Hardware preparation:***
 - 1.) **Things we need:**
    - NC Switch
    - Cables
    - Switch holder (according to the side on which the switch will be and according to the extruder type) download models [here](https://github.com/BlackRiverCoder/Kryal_cube_mk1.2-ABL/tree/main/Assests/Models) and every model types and images are [here](https://github.com/BlackRiverCoder/Kryal_cube_mk1.2-ABL/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#models)
    - Some connectors
    - Screws to attach the switch to the holder

 - 2.) **Assembling the holder:**
    - 1.) Solder wires to the NC Switch and at the end of the cable make connector of your choice (as you can see in the red circle)
    - 2.) With the screws attach the switch to the 3d printed model
    - _Your holder should look like this one:_
